### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Konstantin Sokolov, I'm a software developer with a background in Linguistics, Natural Language Processing, and R&D. 

### Notable Projects

  * Arranged and fulfilled transfer of technical infrastructure to AWS from Yandex Cloud to mitigate sanctions-related risks, which allowed undisturbed business operations in the global market. Secured AWS Activate funding for the AWS-based infrastructure of Evolwe project.
  * Established and led a national machine learning team in a large international company (AliExpress). Delivered multiple projects related to search and recommendation solutions for a large-scale international e-commerce platform.
  * A simulation project in the domain of transportation management targeted at scalable cloud-based infrastructure (OpenStack, AnyLogic), early stage research for a prominent logistics service provider Samokat.
  * A prototype [syntactic annotation tool](https://github.com/vtqveant/ccg-corpus) for OpenCorpora based on categorial grammar, parsing as deduction and proof assistant technology.
  * [An interpreter for natural language commands](https://github.com/vtqveant/open-synsem) for a smart home system based on OpenCCG semantic parser and a hybrid logic model checker.
  * A series of productivity and entertainment oriented virtual assistants for mobile platforms, including a Turing-100 winning virtual assistant Everfriends (originating from the dialogue manager backing Â«Eugene GoostmanÂ» chatbot).
  * National Corporate Internet Helper, a nation-wide self-care web application for corporate clients of Russian mobile network operator MTS.

### Academic Professional Activities

  * Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language (AINL 2013, 2016), Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language & Information Extraction, Social Media and Web Search FRUCT Conference (AINL-ISMW FRUCT 2015), PC member
  * Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language (AINL 2012), St. Petersburg, Russia, co-organizer
  * Effective Training in Computational Linguistics, one-day industrial session, St. Petersburg State University, 2007, co-organizer

### Teaching

  * Formal Methods in Natural Language Processing, a masterâ€™s level selective course covering topics in formal languages (mildly context-sensitive formalisms including CCG, TAG), Unification Grammar, Lambek calculus, parsing as deduction and computational semantics (Montague Grammar, DRT, LFG/Glue, type-theoretical semantics)
  * Statistical Natural Language Processing, covering language models, log-linear and MEMM models, tagging, constituency and dependency parsing, distributional semantics 
  * Human-Computer Interaction, a selective course covering models of human performance, cognitive agents and cognitive architectures (incl. SOAR, Harmony Theory, seq2seq, Memory Networks, attention models)
  * Design of Software, a bachelorâ€™s level course covering software design patterns and design for testability
